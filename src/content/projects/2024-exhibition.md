One day, our teacher asked us to design something for our school exhibition. Me and my friends decided that we're going to pick digital poster with the theme: Movie Poster. Deciding what kind of movie poster I'm going to create was the first task. However, after brainstorming for a couple of days, I had a couple of design, and one of them endep up getting picked.
