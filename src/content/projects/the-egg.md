The Egg was such an famous story that changed many people's life. How it was written, how the narrative unfold. The same goes for me. I want to design a book cover for it, something that captures the narrative essences. Something that will connect with people. The result was something simple, with a flat design. However, it presents numerous "easter eggs" that people will understand if they had read the story.
