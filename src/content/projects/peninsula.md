Horror... a genre were I'm in a love-and-hate relationship with. Like any other, many stories were good, some... not so much, and others are questionable at best. However, I really this subgenre - Horror Survival. You are not fighting some evil ghost (or maybe you are), you are fighting agaisnt the environment. For reference, see the video game The Forest.
